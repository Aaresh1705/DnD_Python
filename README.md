Go to [https://aaresh1705.github.io/DnD_Python/build/web/](https://aaresh1705.github.io/DnD_Python/build/web/) for the character creation.
Made with pygame and pygbag.

## Controls for now:
**PRESS 1:**
- Save the character as `(character name).txt` (There is no way of changing the character name for now other than modifying the txt)

**PRESS 2:**
- Load a character `.txt` save

This program is still in **VERY early beta** and there's still **LOTS** of things that need to be implemented!

## ROADMAP (May change):
- Finish character save file *(deadline: 0/4/2024)*
- Finish the change page *(deadline: 7/4/2024)*
- Finish the Turn page to include turn-based combat *(deadline: 14/4/2024)*
- Polish *(deadline: 0/5/2024)*
